# jotzeit-ui

The UI is based on React Native. Follow the installation steps from the
[Getting Started] (https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html#content) page.

Being ready for development means having node, react-native-cli, and xcode set up. To develop on a device, you also
need to have a iOS developer provisioning profile set up. See the
[Running on Device](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/running-on-device-ios.html) guide for more info.
